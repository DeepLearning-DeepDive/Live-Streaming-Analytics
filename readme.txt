1. Clone the OpenAI model repository and create a new branch:

git clone https://github.com/openai/text-davinci-003.git

git checkout -b larger-context

2. Find the configuration file for the model and edit the parameters for the context length:

vi config/model_config.json

3. Change the context_length parameter to the desired size.

4. Train the model:

python train.py --config config/model_config.json

5. Monitor the training progress with TensorBoard and make sure the model is converging to the desired accuracy.

6. Evaluate the model and save the model checkpoint:

python evaluate.py --config config/model_config.json --model_checkpoint <model_checkpoint_file>

7. Deploy the model checkpoint to production:

python deploy.py --checkpoint <model_checkpoint_file>



*******


1. Download the pretrained openai model text-davinci-003 from the OpenAI repository.

2. Use a text corpus with larger context lengths to train the model.

3. Use a text preprocessing tool like NLTK to tokenize the corpus.

4. Use the OpenAI GPT-2 training toolkit to train the model with the larger context.

5. Use the GPT-2 optimizer to fine-tune the model.

6. Test the model on unseen data to evaluate its performance.

write a code to read 1000 chats from pandas dataframe having 350000 chats and for each batch of 1000 chats,
 a method- Helloworld needs to be called which will write into sqlite for each 1000 chats 


import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# create a connection object to connect to the sqlite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('database_name.db')

# read the csv file using pandas
df = pd.read_csv('chats.csv')

# get the total number of rows
total_rows = df.shape[0]

# loop through all the rows
for i in range(0, total_rows, 1000):
    # get the 1000 chats from the data frame
    df_1000 = df.iloc[i:i+1000]

    # call the helloworld method
    Helloworld(df_1000)

    # write the 1000 rows into sqlite
    df_1000.to_sql('table_name', con = conn, if_exists='append', index = False)

conn.close()
